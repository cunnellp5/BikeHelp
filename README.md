# Fixme-Bike
Capstone by Philip Cunnell

### Description:
This is a tool for bicyclists and bicycle stores. When a bicyclist breaks down on the road, they can use my app to send out a "help request". Participating bicycle stores can then see the requests and engage the broken down bicyclist. Ideally, I imagine the stores to send out a bicyclist of their own with the tools to fix the bicyclist in distress.
