I'm Philip Cunnell a Geophysicist turned Developer! I began this journey of coding in October 2016 with no prior experience. 
This is my capstone project for Galvanize!


Fixme-Bike is inspired by my constant battle with Denvers thorns and broken glass. I created an app that allows for a real time
communication between bicyclists and bike stores. When your bike breaks down you may "ping" a help request. These requests
are then seen by the participating bike stores. Ideally, the stores can then send a helper to fix your bike and make money
themselves. 


Some challenges were the fact I learned Vuejs and how to use jwt for this project. Wrapping my head around the flow of data and
how to authorize users was difficult but a great learning experience. 


In the future: 
1) I'd like to add map features just like uber 
2) Add a paypal system 
3) push my code into a mobile first framework, like Quasar.
